# pietHS

An interpreter for the Piet graphical programming language, written in Haskell

## Status

Pre-alpha, since it's pretty much one weekend's hack at this time.
This means, there's still a little functionality missing for successfully running a Hello World program.

## What is Piet?

Piet is an esoterical programming language in which programs look like abstract paintings.

The language was developed by David Morgan-Mar and is named after Piet Mondrian,
who pioneered the field of geometric abstract art.
